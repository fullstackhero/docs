## Problem Statement

<p>Ever gone through the pain of setting up new Projects from scratch each and every time? fullstackhero aims to
address this pain point by offering Starting Points aka Boilerplates for various technologies that can help save
over 200+ hours of Development and Research Time for Developers and Teams.</p>

## Solution

We intend to provide Clean and Well structured Boilerplates with top-notch quality following standard coding practices and Clean Architecture principles that makes your development experience seamless.
</p>
<p class="code-green">Most importantly, fullstackhero is completely FREE to use!</p>

Bottomline, using fullstackhero, your new projects will be up and running in no time.


## Vision

fullstackhero is not a single repository or project, rather a collection of boilerplates out of which you get to choose your preference. In the long term, fullstackhero would ideally have multiple API projects that are written in various technologies like .NET, Node.js, GoLang and multiple client applications that are built on awesome tech like Blazor, Vue.js, React, Angular and so on.

fullstackhero should be the one-stop that caters to the needs of various developers in various technology. This obviously would require a lot of community adaptation and contributions.

As of the initial releases, fullstackhero supports an API Project built on Microsoft's newest .NET 6 and the front-end application (that consumes the .NET 6 Web API) built with Blazor WebAssembly!
