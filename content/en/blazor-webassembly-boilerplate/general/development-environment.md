fullstackhero's **Blazor WebAssembly Boilerplate** Project Development needs you to have the following applications / tools available on your machine. Please Note that this project is being built on a Windows 10 Machine using Visual Studio Code IDE.

## .NET SDK

As mentioned earlier, this project is built with the latest available .NET SDK, which is .NET 6.0.

Ensure that you have the latest version of the SDK available - [Download from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

{{< alert icon="💡" text="Note : At the time of compiling this documentation, the latest version available was SDK 6.0.200" />}}


## IDE

Visual Studio Code IDE is the recommended IDE to use for fullstackhero's Blazor WebAssembly Boilerplate Project Development. If you are not already using this IDE, consider switching to it. It's definitely worth it! (_Fun Fact : I recently switched from Visual Studio 2019 Community to Visual Studio Code and it's been awesome!_)

However, you are always free to use your choice of IDEs as well.

Incase you intend to use Visual Studio Code for development, here are a bunch of helpful extensions that I use:
- EditorConfig for VS Code
- C#
- C# Extensions
- Docker
- Markdown All in One
- NuGet Gallery
- Material Icon Theme
- REST Client
